Trafiic Sign Recognition System
The system was created to identify traffic signs from input images.
The model uses a CNN and is trained on a dataset of German traffic signs. The dataset contains 51839 32px*32px RGB images of  42 types of traffic signs. During preprocessing, the images are converted to grayscale. Histogram equalization is used to standardise contrast in all images.
The Keras ImageDataGenerator is used to generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. One-hot encoding is used for the labels.
After training for 150 epochs, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.93 on the training set and 0.95 on the test set.
