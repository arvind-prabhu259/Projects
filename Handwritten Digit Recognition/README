Handwritten Digit Recognition.
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset.
OpenCV is used to detect digits in the input image and the model makes predictions on them.
The output is printed along with the image of the bounding box

ISSUES:
Random contours, blurry images

SOLUTIONS:(to be implemented)
limit size of bounding boxes.
