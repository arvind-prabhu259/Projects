Real time emotion recognition
The system performs facial emotion recognition on an input video feed. 
A CNN is used to extract features from the input image, which the fully connected layers use to identify the emotion being displayed. 
The model was trained on the FER 2013 dataset, containing 35,887 grayscale images of faces. These images are divided into seven different emotion categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.
After training fppr 25 epochs, the model achieved a peak accuracy of
OpenCV is used to process the input video from the webcam and extract frames.
